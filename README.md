# Cipher - Secure FIR Lodging App :closed_lock_with_key:

🔒 **About**
Cipher is a cutting-edge project that aims to revolutionize data integrity by utilizing decentralized infrastructure and blockchain technology. Its primary goal is to provide an immutable and incorruptible system for recording initial information reports (FIR), thus mitigating the risks of data tampering and systemic corruption.

🚀 **Features**
- Securely lodge First Information Reports (FIRs) using advanced blockchain technology.
- Decentralized infrastructure ensuring data integrity and tamper-proof records.
- Peer-to-peer IPFS module for efficient and reliable data storage and retrieval.
- Optimized backend infrastructure using container orchestration for maximum performance.
- Achieved an impressive 99% uptime, ensuring continuous accessibility to the application.
- Reduced server maintenance by 40%, leading to cost-effectiveness and smooth operation.
- Data Analytics: Leverage powerful data analytics to gain insights from the lodged FIRs and detect patterns for informed decision-making.

🛠️ **Backend Technology**
The backend of Cipher has been developed using cutting-edge technologies to ensure security, efficiency, and reliability.

- **Blockchain**: The heart of Cipher's data integrity lies in its use of blockchain technology, which provides a decentralized and immutable ledger for FIR records.

- **Container Orchestration**: To optimize backend infrastructure, we have implemented container orchestration, enabling easy management and scalability of backend services.

- **Peer-to-peer IPFS**: Cipher utilizes a peer-to-peer IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) module for data storage. This ensures efficient and reliable file storage, reducing the chances of data loss.
